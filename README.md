Project Purpose:
Are you ever stuck with finding something to watch? There are so many genres and so many streaming platforms, how can you possibly find what you are in the mood for?
cartoovie aims to fix that problem. From answering a short 10-question survey, cartoovie will automatically generate a list of movies that are tailored to what you're feeling in the present moment.
Whether you want to watch a newer movie or an older movie, an old western or a futuristic film, cartoovie can help!
Users will be able to favorite movies and find out where to stream them on whichever platform the film is available on. Additionally, users can mark whether they have watched the film or not, and 
users can refresh for more options.
